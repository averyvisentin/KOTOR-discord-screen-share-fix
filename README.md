# KOTOR 1 & 2 Discord Screen Share Fix

A quick fix I found a year or so ago to resolve screen sharing issues with KOTOR on Discord.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Disable Discord Overlay**
   - Open Discord and go to **User Settings**.
   - Navigate to **App Settings** > **Game Overlay**.
   - Disable the **Enable in-game overlay** option.

2. **Adjust Screen Sharing Settings**
   - Still in **User Settings**, go to **Voice & Video**.
   - Scroll all the way to the bottom to find the **Screen Sharing** section.
   - Disable both:
     - **Use our advanced technology to capture your screen**
     - **Use an experimental method to capture audio from applications**

## Additional Tips

- **Save Often**: To avoid any potential crashes, make sure to save your game frequently and in different slots.

This should help you share your KOTOR gameplay on Discord without any issues!

I made a post on reddit about this as well when I discovered it, but I'd like to have all my things in one place.
